# Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.
#
# Â 
#
#
# Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].
#
# Â 
#
#
# The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.
#
# Â 
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
# Output: 10
